# How to install and run the project

To run the project, you need the Front-End and Back-End repositories downloaded.

Step by step guide:

-   Download the Front-End and Back-End repositories into one folder called "Bootcamper Journal Ritual".
-   Open this folder in VSCode.
-   Navigate in the terminal with "cd" to the Back-End repository. Install the required modules by running "npm install" in the terminal.
-   Run the reset-db and server scripts with "npm run reset-db" and "npm run dev".
-   Ensure the server is listening on a local port. It will confirm this in the terminal.
-   Open a server with the Live Server extension, navigating to the Front-End project.
-   Open the console by right clicking in the browser > inspect > console, checking that there are no connection errors.
-   Submited a daily journal entry by entering a Secret User ID between 1 and 40, clicking on an emoji, and typing responses to the four questions.
-   Present the "Submit journal entry" button to submit the journal entry. Your data will be sent to the Sequel database, then retrieved again with a fetch command, before being displayed on the webpage.

# Current features

-   Enter one day's journal entry
-   Display previous day's journal entry
-   Functioning requires a declared Secret User ID

Dynamic features:

-   A pop-up appears when journal entry submitted
-   Emojis alight to show which is chosen
-   The journal entry boxes hide when the day's journal has been submitted
-   The journal history log displays for the previous day's journal when the document is loaded, and is updated when the submission button is pressed.

# Sequel database information

-   Can intake information for Secret User ID's 1 through 40.

# Known bugs or limitations

Bugs

-   None outstanding

Limitations

-   Only 40 Secret User IDs have been set up in the Sequel database (Secret User ID 1-->40).
-   Any developer can interact with our database should they find the Sequel API Key. We do not have license requirements setup yet.

# Future features [and estimated development time]

-   Login functionality, so users don't need to enter their Secret ID every time [1 day]
-   Display multiple journal entries [1 day]
-   Edit functionality on posts [2 days]
-   Delete functionality [1 day]
-   A timer to help users focus on their daily extra revision task for twenty minutes [0.5 day]
-   A visual tracker to mark your progress and streaks (i.e. how many days you have completed this ritual) [1 day]
-   An optional, user-customisable motivational quote space [0.5 day]
-   Soothing audio which can be toggled on/off [2 days]
